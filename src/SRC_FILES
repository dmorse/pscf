File Name Conventions:

  Files named <base>_mod.f  are Fortran 90 modules
  Files named <name>.fp.f   are preprocessor input files. 

  The un-preprocessed version of the main program is src/pscf.fp.f. 
  A corresponding compilable fortran program is generated by applying
  a preprocessor script, which installs the resulting program in the 
  build directory. See the end of this file for a discussion of the 
  use of a preprocessor.


Main Program     
-------------

pscf.fp.f
	Main program (preprocessor input file). Used to generate the 
	compilable fortran file pscf.f in the build directory.

Utilities
----------

        developer/api documentation for the module. 

grid_basis_mod.f
	Contains routines to convert between representations of a

	on a regular grid. 

Self-Consistent Field
----------------------

chemistry_mod.f
	Defines data structures required to specify chemistry of an 
	incompressible polymer blend (chi, Kuhn lengths, block lengths,

	output this data. 

chain_mod.f
	Defines a derived type chain_type that contains the
	q(r,s) =qf and q^{+}(r,s) =qr functions for a chain, and 
	information about discretization in r and s. Also defines 
	arrays of chain_types and subroutines to allocate and 
	destroy these arrays. 

step_mod.f
        Routines to integrate one time step of modified diffusion
	equation, using the Rasmussen-Kaloskas pseudo-spectral
	algorithm and extrapolation with respect to contour 
	length step size.

scf_mod.fp.f
	Contains routines to solve diffusion equation by the
	pseudo-spectral method, and to calculate monomer 
        concentration fields, the free and energy, and stress.
	Note: scf_mod.fp.f is a preprocessor input file, which
	is used to generate file scf_mod.f in the build directory.

Iteration
---------

iterate_mod.fp.f
	Iterates scf equations to convergence. Currently contains
	Newton-Raphson (NR) algorithm for both fixed and variable 
	unit cells. Note: File iterate_mod.fp.f is a preprocessor
	input file, which is used to generate file iterate_mod.f
        in the build directory.

sweep_mod
        Used to conduct a "sweep" along a path through the space 
        of SCF input parameters (i.e., chi, block_lengths, etc).
        Implements 1st and 2nd order continuation of solutions 
        along such a path.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

  Several fortran files are generated by applying a python 
  preprocessor script named FORPEDO to corresponding preprocessor 
  input files.  This script is included as part of the pscf package 
  in a subdirectory of the tools/python directory. 
  
  The relevant preprocesor input files are:

     src/pscf.fp.f 
     src/iterate/iterate_mod.fp.f 
     src/scf/scf_mod.fp.f 

  These are fortran files that contain preprocessor directives that
  control conditional compilation of some sections of code. The 
  FORPEDO preprocessor is used here in manner similar to the use 
  of the standard C preprocessor to control conditional compilation 
  in C and C++ programs. Preprocessing each of these files generates 
  a Fortran file with the same name as the preprocessor input file 
  without the .fp. string. The resulting fortran files are thus named:
     
     build/scf.f 
     build/iterate_mod.f 
     build/scf_mod.f 
  
  These preprocessed fortran files installed in the build directory 
  from which make is invoked, rather than in the src/ directory. If 
  pscf is built using the simple makefile that is provided in the 
  pscf/make directory, then these files are installed in the 
  pscf/make directory. If pscf is built out-of-source using cmake,
  by invoking cmake and make from a build directory outside the 
  pscf/ directory tree, then these fortran files will be installed 
  in that build directory tree.

  An external script is used for preprocessing because Fortran 
  (unlike C) does not provide a standard preprocessor.  The use of 
  a preprocessor makes it easier for developers to maintain code 
  that contains experimental features that are not yet ready to be 
  released as part of a stable version, without maintaining separate 
  development and release version. Sections of code containing 
  features that are not ready for prime time are surrounded by 
  conditional compilation directives and are excluded from release
  versions of the corresponding fortran files. 

  If the *.fp.f preprocessor files are modified, and the program 
  is then recompiled using either cmake or the make file in the 
  pscf/make directory, then the *.f fortran files will be regenerated
  regenerated as part of the build process. When compiled with make
  in the src/make directory, the src/make/*.f fortran files are also
  removed by the 'make clean' command.
