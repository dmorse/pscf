----------------------------------------------------------------
These notes describe how to compile PSCF from sources using cmake
on several different unix-like operating systems The following
software packages must be installed and accessible before 
attempting to compile PSCF:

1) git (in order to clone the source code)
1) cmake (to build a makefile)
2) a fortran 90 compiler 
   (e.g., gfortran in the gnu compiler collection)
3) LAPACK linear algebra library
4) FFTW version 3.x fast fourier transform library

Comments about how to find and install these dependencies are
given below separately for each operating system:
----------------------------------------------------------------
To build from source on Mac OSX: 

    Command Line Tools and XCode:

    To create an environment in which you can compile from 
    source on OSX, you will generally first need to install 
    either the (relatively small) Apple command line tools 
    or the (much larger) Apple XCode integrated development
    environment, which includes the command line tools. 
    Apple XCode is available free from the app store.

    The command line tools the full XCode package both install
    git, so it is not necessary to install this separately

    The OXS operating system also appears to come with a 
    version of LAPACK, and the BLAS library upon which it 
    depends.

    Package Managers: HomeBrew vs. MacPorts.

    The remaining dependencies (cmake, gfortran and fftw) can be most 
    easily installed using either the MacPorts or Homebrew package 
    manager systems.  These are both systems for managing open-source 
    software, most of which was written for unix, on Darwin unix
    subsystem of the the Mac OSX.  The choice of package managers is 
    up to you, but you should avoid using both on the same machine. 
    We also recommend against using the older Fink manager, which is
    obsolete.  If either Homebrew or MacPorts is already installed
    and in use on your machine, you should use the existing system
    and not install the alternative, because they do not play well 
    together.  If neither Homebrew or MacPorts is installed, our 
    experience installing PSCF gives a slight preference for Homebrew, 
    which was slightly easier to use, but we have succeeded in 
    installing the dependencies of PSCF on machines with OSX 10.11 
    using both software management systems. Instructions for both
    systems are given separately below.

    Installing dependencies via Homebrew:

    To install from a command line terminal using homebrew:

    > brew install cmake
    > brew install gcc --with-fortran
    > brew install fftw 

    Installing dependencies via Macports:

    After MacPorts is installed, to install the required dependencies 
    using the most recent version of the gnu compiler collection (gcc), 
   which is gcc 5.X at the time of writing, enter:
    
    > sudo port install cmake
    > sudo port install gcc5
    > sudo port install fftw-3 +gfortran

    Note that MacPorts (unlike homebrew) requires you to use "sudo"
    to execute installation as the superuser, and thus will ask for
    a password after each of the above commands.

    We found that the gcc-5 port installs the gfortran Fortran 90 
    compiler at /usr/opt/local/bin/gfortran-mp-5 . Versions compiled 
    with other versions of gcc (e.g., 4.9) seem to be placed in the 
    same directory with a different numerical suffix, e.g., 
    gfortran-mp-49.  CMake was unable to find this compiler 
    executable without help.  To remedy this, you should set the 
    FC environment variable (the path to a Fortran compiler) to 
    point to the absolute path to the gfortran executable before
    attempting to compile, by entering, for example:

    > FC=/usr/opt/local/bin/gfortran-mp-5
    > export FC

    If expect to compile this and other fortran programs repeatedly, 
    you may want to put this in your .bashrc or .profile bash 
    configuration file.

    Getting the source code:

    To obtain the PSCF source code from github:

    > git clone git@github.com/dmorse/pscf.git

    Before compiling, you should make a new directory in which 
    the program will be built "out-of-source". This build directory
    should not be subdirectory of the pscf/ directory. The following 
    assumes that the build directory is called pscf-build, and that 
    it and pscf/ are subdirectories of the same parent directory.
    Starting from the common parent directory, enter:

    > mkdir pscf-build
    > cd pscf-build
    > cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install ../pscf
    > make -j 4
    > make install 

    In the "cmake" command, the string "/path/to/install" is 
    the root of path used for installation. The executable 
    will be installed in the bin directory of 
    "/path/to/install". The last argument "../pscf" If you 
    use "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=.", the executable and other
    files that you generate will be installed in tree rooted
    at the build directory (e.g., pscf-build). The final
    pscf executable is self-contained and can be copied to 
    wherever you want after it is created.

    For developers: To build a Mac OSX *.dmg binary installer,
    as well as *.tar and *.zip source code archive files, when
    working on a Mac, after completing compilation and 
    installation, enter:

    > make package

----------------------------------------------------------------
To build on an Ubuntu linux machine.

    Use the Ubuntu software manager or the command line apt-get 
    utility to install the following packages:

    git
    cmake
    gfortran
    fftw3-dev
    liblapack3

    To obtain the PSCF source code from github, as for OS X,
    type:

    > git clone git@github.com/dmorse/pscf.git

    The steps to compile and install are the same as for Mac OSX:

    > mkdir pscf-build
    > cd pscf-build 
    > cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install ../pscf
    > make -j 4
    > make install 

    Developers: To build *.deb package for installation of binary
    executables on other Ubuntu and debian systems, as well as
    *.tar and *.zip source code archives, after installing on 
    your machine, simply enter:

    > make package

    To check the *.deb file for semi-detailed information: 

	# This extracts multiple files
	ar -vx pscf-1.0.0-Linux.deb
	# See the files that would be installed
	tar tvfz data.tar.gz 

----------------------------------------------------------------
To build on a Fedora linux distribution:

    Instructions for Fedora are similar to those for Ubuntu,
    except that one should use the native Fedora graphical 
    software manager or the yum command line tool to install 
    dependencies.

    The required Fedora packages are:

    cmake
    gcc-gfortran
    lapack
    fftw-devel

    To install these packages from the command line, enter:

    > sudo yum install cmake
    > sudo yum install gcc-gfortran
    > sudo yum install lapack
    > sudo yum install fftw-devel

    Instructions for obtaining source code, compiling and installing
    are the same as for Max OSX and Ubuntu.

    Developers: On a Fedora machine, you can build a *.rpm package
    and *.tar and *.zip archives by entering

    > make package

    from within the build directory.

    To check the RPM for detailed information (Metadata, Dependencies, 
    and File Contents), enter:

    > rpm --info -qpR -qlvp pscf-1.0.0-Linux.rpm 
----------------------------------------------------------------
To build on Minnesota Computer Institute (MSI) Mesabi computer, 
using linux modules and the Intel compiler:

    Use the following commands to load the required modules:

    > module load cmake
    > module load intel mkl
    > module load fftw

    The remaining instruction for how to obtain and compile the
    source code are the same as OSX or linux, except that one
    tell cmake to use the intel compiler by adding the option
    "-DUSE_INTEL=1" to the cmake command. The required command
    is thus:

    > cmake -DUSE_INTEL=1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install ../pscf

----------------------------------------------------------------
For installation we leverage fixup_bundle: 

https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/BundleUtilities.html

This requires unique APP vars for each OS (see src/CMakeLists.txt 
for details)
