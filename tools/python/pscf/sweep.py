    a sequence range [0, n].

    Implementation: Use of the [] subscript operator is implemented by 
    overloading the __getitem__ method.

        value of some control parameter that is varied in the sweep, and
        expr2 (the second column) as f_Helmholtz, the Helmholtz free 
        energy per monomer.
