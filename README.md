# PSCF - Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory

Copyright (2002-2017) Regents of the University of Minnesota

PSCF is a program for numerically solving the polymer self-consistent 
field theory (SCFT) for spatially periodic structures formed by block 
copolymer melts and mixtures of block copolymers with linear 
homopolymers and/or small molecule solvents.

The version of the PSCF package provided here is the original version,
which was written in Fortran 90. A newer C++/Cuda version that allows
use of GPU acceleration, is available in a separate github repository 
at https://github.com/dmorse/pscfpp. Currently, the C++/Cuda version 
and Fortran versions of PSCF each contain a few features that are not 
available in the other code.

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation. A copy of this license is included in
the LICENSE file in the top-level PSCF directory.

# Dependencies

PSCF depends upon the FFTW fast Fourier transform library and the
LAPACK linear algebra library.  These packages must be installed
before attempting to compile the program from source.

# User Documentation

A web user manual is available at https://pscf.readthedocs.io

Instructions for compiling the program from source, as well how to
install a precompiled executable on some systems, are given in the 
user maual.

The source files for the user manual are text files that are stored in
the doc/user-man directory. The relevant files have file extension .rst.

We recommend that users also refer to the 2016 reference article from the 
journal Macromolecules, cited below. This article provides a brief 
introduction to SCFT, discusses some of the algorithms and file formats 
used in the PSCF program, and discusses some issues and questions faced 
by first time users.

# Developer Documentation

A local copy of the developer API documentation, which includes
documentation for all modules, subroutines and public variables, may
be regenerated by following instructions given in the file doc/README.
The resulting html pages are installed in the doc/devel-man directory.
