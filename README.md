# PSCF - Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory

Copyright (2002-2016) Regents of the University of Minnesota

PSCF is a Fortran 90 program for numerically solving the polymer
self-consistent field theory for periodic microstructures formed
by incompressible melts or mixtures of linear block copolymers,
linear homopolymers, and small molecule solvents.

# Dependencies

 PSCF depends upon the FFTW fast Fourier transform library and the
 LAPACK linear algebra library.  These packages must be installed
 before attempting to compile the program from source.

# User Documentation

A web user manual is avalaible at:

    https://pscf.readthedocs.io

Instructions for compiling the program from source, as well as various
ways to install precompiled executables, are given in the user manual.

The source files for the user manual are text files that are stored in
the doc/user-man directory. The relevant files have file extension .rst.

# Developer Documentation

A local copy of the developer API documentation, which includes
documentation for all modules, subroutines and public variables, may
be regenerated by following instructions given in the file doc/README.
The resulting .html page are installed in doc/devel-man.

file regarding the use of preprocessor to generate some files.
